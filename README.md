## Development Process

The work was roughly broken down to coding and all other aspects. Ramona worked mostly on the coding while Travis data wrangled, drew up the story board, and fixed up the bar chart/polished the final code. This project took us around 18 hours each. It was a very steep learning curve as neither of us had ever used javascript before and both have a very minimal web design background.
